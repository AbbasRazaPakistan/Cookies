    <p>
      Every cookie made at the Kevin Cookie company is crafted with only the
      finest ingredients. Butter from grass fed cows. Unbleached flour with the
      best flavor and textures. Organic sugar only from Pakistan. Eggs from
      chickens that listen to classical music. Even our water is special. It
      comes from the Cascade Mountain springs that we hike up to retrieve.
      Baking is our passion and we take it very seriously.
